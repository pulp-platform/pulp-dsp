/**
  @defgroup BasicAbs Vector Absolute Value
  This module contains the glue code for Vector Absolute Value. The kernel codes (kernels) are in
  the Moducle Vector Absolute Value Kernels.

  The Vector Absolute Value computes the absolute value of a vector on an element-by-element basis.
  The vectors are multiplied element-by-element and then summed.
  <pre>
  pDst[n] = abs(pSrc[n]),   0 <= n < blockSize.
  </pre>
  There are separate functions for floating point, integer, and fixed point 32- 16- 8-bit data
  types. For lower precision integers (16- and 8-bit), functions exploiting SIMD instructions are
  provided.

  The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example plp_dot_prod_i32s):
  <pre>
  \<pulp\> _ \<function name\> _ \<data type\> \<precision\> \<method\> _ \<isa extension\>, with

  data type = {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points

  precision = {32, 16, 8} bits

  method = {s, p} respectively meaning single core or parallel multicore implementation.

  isa extension = rv32im, xpulpv2, etc. of which rv32im is the most general one.

  </pre>

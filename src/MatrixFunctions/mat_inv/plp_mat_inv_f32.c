/**
  @defgroup MatInv matrix inversion
  This module contains the glue code for matrix inversion. The kernel codes
  (kernels) are in the Module matrix inversion Kernels.

  The inverse of a matrix of shape MxN is another matrix of shape NxN, such
  that

  \f[
    I = A \cdot A^{-1}
  \f]

  The inverse is defined only if the input matrix is square and non-singular
  (the determinant is non-zero). The function checks that the input and output
  matrices are square and of the same size. Matrix inversion is numerically
  sensitive and the PULP DSP library only supports matrix inversion of
  floating-point matrices.

  @par Algorithm
  The Gauss-Jordan method is used to find the inverse. The algorithm performs a
  sequence of elementary row-operations until it reduces the input matrix to an
  identity matrix. Applying the same sequence of elementary row-operations to an
  identity matrix yields the inverse matrix.

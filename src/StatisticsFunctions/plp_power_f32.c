   Calculates the sum of squares of the input vector.
   There are separate functions for floating point, integer, and fixed point 32- 16- 8-bit data
   types. For lower precision integers (16- and 8-bit), functions exploiting SIMD instructions are
   provided.

   The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example plp_dot_prod_i32s):
   <pre>
   \<pulp\> _ \<function name\> _ \<data type\> \<precision\> \<method\> _ \<isa extension\>, with

   data type = {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points

   precision = {32, 16, 8} bits

   method = {s, p} respectively meaning single core or parallel multicore implementation.

   isa extension = rv32im, xpulpv2, etc. of which rv32im is the most general one.

   </pre>
